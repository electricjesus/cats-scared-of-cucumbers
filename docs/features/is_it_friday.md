# Feature: Is It Friday Yet?

## Overview
This feature tests a simple day-of-week checker that determines if the current day is Friday. It demonstrates basic user interaction and response validation for weekend planning applications.

## Prerequisites
- Browser requirements: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- Test data: No external data required (uses fixed day scenarios)
- Environment setup: Local or remote web server hosting the day checker application

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario: Sunday isn't Friday
- **Given**: Today is set to Sunday in the application
- **When**: User asks whether it's Friday yet
- **Then**: Application should respond with "Nope"

**Purpose**: Validates that non-Friday days correctly return negative responses

**Business Value**: Ensures users get accurate information about the current day status

## Implementation Details

### Browser Automation Approach
- Use page interactions to simulate user input
- Validate text content and UI responses
- Ensure proper loading states and error handling

### Expected User Journey
1. User navigates to the day checker page
2. System displays current day (or allows day selection)
3. User clicks "Is it Friday?" button or similar trigger
4. System displays appropriate response based on the day

## Browser Compatibility
- Chrome: ✅ Supported
- Firefox: ✅ Supported  
- Safari: ✅ Supported
- Edge: ✅ Supported

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Timing Issues**: Ensure proper waits for page load and element visibility
- **Text Matching**: Use flexible text matching to handle case sensitivity and whitespace
- **Browser Differences**: Some browsers may render responses differently

### Debug Steps
1. Verify the day checker application is accessible
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Ensure test selectors match actual page elements
4. Validate network requests complete successfully

## Future Enhancements
- Add tests for all days of the week
- Include timezone handling scenarios
- Test mobile browser compatibility
- Add performance benchmarks for response times
